# custom-activity-app


This is a quick start for custom activities in JourneyBuilder.

What you need to configure to make this work :

	backend/configAPI.json  :  You need to put your clientID and Secret to use the MC API. (Optionnal)

	public/config.json : add the name, the desc, the key of your custom activity.
	public/images/icon.png : put your best icon in it.


This quickStart will do a "Hello world !" for each contact in your journey.
